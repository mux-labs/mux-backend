# Mux Backend

Backend infrastructure for **Mux Protocol** — powering invisible wallets, payment orchestration, and smart contract interaction on **Stellar (Soroban)**.

**Version:** 1.0.0 | **Last Updated:** January 2026

Mux Backend abstracts blockchain complexity behind a secure, Web2-friendly API, enabling users to interact with crypto without managing keys, gas, or wallets directly.

---

## Overview

Mux Backend is the trusted coordination layer between:

* Web2 authentication providers (Clerk / Better Auth)
* Stellar accounts and Soroban smart contracts
* Frontend clients and SDKs

It handles wallet creation, transaction orchestration, fee sponsorship, and on-chain/off-chain state reconciliation.

---

## Core Responsibilities

* Invisible wallet creation and management
* Secure custody and encryption of Stellar keypairs
* Transaction relaying and fee sponsorship
* Soroban smart contract invocation
* Spending limit and policy enforcement
* Indexing and caching on-chain data
* Serving APIs to frontend applications

---

## Key Features

### 🔐 Invisible Wallets

* Automatic Stellar account creation on user signup
* No seed phrases or wallet prompts
* Keys encrypted and stored securely server-side

### 🔁 Transaction Orchestration

* Backend-signed and sponsored transactions
* Internal user-to-user transfers
* Support for batching and relaying

### 🧠 Account Abstraction Layer

* User identity mapped to blockchain accounts
* Programmable spending limits
* Recovery and key rotation flows

### 📦 Smart Contract Integration

* Soroban contract interaction
* Wallet registry and policy enforcement contracts
* Future support for smart wallet accounts

### 📊 Indexing & Caching

* Track balances and transactions
* Human-readable transaction history
* Cached reads for fast UX

---

## Security Model (MVP)

* Private keys are never exposed to clients
* Keys are encrypted at rest
* All blockchain transactions are signed server-side
* Fees are sponsored by the platform
* Auth provider is the source of truth for identity

> ⚠️ This MVP uses a custodial model. Progressive decentralization is planned.

---

## Design Principles

* **Crypto is infrastructure, not UX**
* **Auth-first, wallet-second**
* **Correctness > flexibility**
* **Explicit over magical abstractions**
* **Upgrade paths over rewrites**

---

## Roadmap

* Smart contract wallet accounts (Soroban)
* Session keys and spending limits
* Wallet recovery flows
* Fiat on/off-ramps via Stellar anchors
* Optional self-custody export for advanced users
